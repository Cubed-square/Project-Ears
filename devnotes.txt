FOXOS DEV NOTES: [Make sure these are updated as things are completed!]
Ideas:
 - External hardware loader:load .py files from a folder in the pico 2 to allow users to create custom integrations into the hardware EASILY
 - Re-order some features: Re-order the layout to make it more streamlined, could be done by simply changing names and which apps.___ to open in the check() function
 - Optimize optimize optimize: Always important, but especially as new versions of FoxOS roll out, make sure processes are correctly written to help with our limited SRAM
 - Experiment with different microcontrollers: not everyone has a raspberry pico 2, so different ports could be designed for different boards such as the ESP32s or Arduinos [THIS IS A BIG PROJECT]
 - Fill in the Placeholders!
