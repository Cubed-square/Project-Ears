This is the code and document associated with a potential invention using a raspberry pico 2 and 2004 LCD display to make a wrist mounted computer.

The code contains a few different pieces, mostly pertaining to the LCD I2C API and the setup for that API.
The main section however is designed to function as a miniature operating system for the user.

Versions will roll out with reasonable regulariy as features are added and hardware is integrated.

This REPO is still under development, more changes are likely in the future
